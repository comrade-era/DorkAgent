## Requirements
- **Python 3.11.9** (recommended)

## Installation
1. Git clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yee-yore/DorkAgent.git
cd DorkAgent
```

2. Install dependencies (recommended)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: DorkAgent will also **auto-install** all required packages on first run if they are missing.

3. Set up your API keys

Copy the template and fill in your keys:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

The program will also **prompt for API keys** and save them to `.env` file automatically on first run.

### Required API keys
- `SERPER_API_KEY` - **Required** (Get from https://serper.dev/)
- At least **one** LLM API key:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-5, etc.)
  - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude models
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY` - For Gemini models

## Usage
Run DorkAgent:
```bash
python dorkagent.py
```

The program will guide you through:
1. Selecting an LLM provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini)
2. Choosing a model dynamically from the available models
3. Entering target domains
4. Selecting scan depth
5. Optionally enabling notifications

Security assessment reports are saved to `./log/` with `YYMMDD_HHMMSS` timestamps.

## Customize
1. The number of google results (`serper_dev_tool.py` inside `site-packages/crewai_tools/tools/serper_dev_tool/`)
```bash
class SerperDevTool(BaseTool):
    ...
    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = SerperDevToolSchema
    base_url: str = "https://google.serper.dev"
    n_results: int = 10 # min: 10, max: 100
    ...
```
2. Duration of google search results (`serper_dev_tool.py`)

```bash
# https://serper.dev/playground

def _make_api_request(self, search_query: str, search_type: str) -> dict:
    ...
    payload = json.dumps({"q": search_query, "num": self.n_results, "tbs": "qdr:m"}) # Past week: "qdr:w", Past month: "qdr:m"
    ...
```
3. Google dorks (`task()`)
```bash
# Reference https://github.com/TakSec/google-dorks-bug-bounty
```
4. Agents (`agents()`)
```bash
# https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents
```


## Update Log
- **2025-12-11**: **DorkAgent v1.4** - Dynamic model selection via API (choose from available models at runtime), added Pydantic models for structured task output validation, improved code quality with CONVENTIONS.md compliance fixes
- **2025-09-29**: Major code refactoring for improved maintainability (@wjdrud2532 PR #3). Split monolithic 800+ line file into modular architecture (config.py, agents.py, tasks.py, utils.py), fixed dependency auto-installation to work before module imports, added timestamps to report filenames (YYMMDD_HHMMSS format), enforced code conventions with standardized import order and removed all inline comments, maintained 100% backward compatibility with no breaking changes
- **2025-08-11**: Enhanced security reports with specific information disclosure details, fixed critical notification race condition bug, improved attack vector analysis with actual parameters and payloads, added comprehensive development documentation (CLAUDE.md), restored requirements.txt format
- **2025-05-18**: Modified README.md and banner, Added juicy google dorks, Medium article (https://medium.com/@yee-yore/llm-powered-agent-for-automated-google-dorking-dcb14d609dc2)
- **2025-04-17**: Removed tasks(old).py, the version prior to prompt engineering; Deleted Google Dork for finding "Confidential" documents (most results were merely informative); Removed Google Dork targeting login panels; Added settings to help avoid LLM provider rate limits; Integrated Gemini Flash 2.0 (free to use and currently considered the best value LLM); Merged tasks.py and agents.py into dorkagent.py for simplified maintenance
- **2025-04-01**: Added hybrid LLM option (GPT & Claude); Added dork `intitle:"IIS Windows Server"`; Applied prompt engineering to tasks.py; Added default depth consideration for subdomain inputs; Added `requirements.txt` for Windows/MacOS compatibility
